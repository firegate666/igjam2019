h1. What is this?

Usually your are facing the problem to create multiple screenshots for your game store page on Android and especially on iOS.
Creating all these screenshot can be quite some work.

This little script helped me to create a lot of screenshots in all required resolutions for my game.

h2. Pre-conditions

All resolutions you need have to be setup once in your game player.
You can do this in your game view by clicking the resolution drop down.
If your resolution does not already exist, use the (+) button at the bottom and add it manually.

h2. How to use this?

- Take the ScreenshotUtility script and add it to a game object that is your game.
- Configure the target folder and set up some sizes for your game that you want to capture. Make sure they are added to your editor (see above)
- Configure the Screenshot Key
- Start the game and play until the screen you want to capture
- Press the hotkey

Screenshots will be take and saved to your target directory
